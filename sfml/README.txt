There are a lot of small programs/games. Each in separate folder.
One of my first projects - these are not perfect, but helped me to learn programming.
In each folder, there's a compiled program, Makefile to make progam and .png file to show how it looks like when running.
In order to compile programs, you need to have SFML installed (apt-get install sfml / pacman -S sfml, depending on your distribution).
